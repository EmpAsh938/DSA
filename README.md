# DSA
This repo essentially consists of all necessary solutions for the problems to solve as much as possible problems of data structures and algorithms.
## Arrays
1. **Reversing an array**
	- Reversing an array is an easy task. All you have to do is loop from the last index of an array ***i.e. n-1 to 0***. Now you can simply display on the screen or store in a new array.  
2. **Finding maximum and minimum number in an array**
	- Idea is simple for this too. First approach is to sort an array and take first and last elements as minimum and maximum or you can compare the each element with each other and get either max or min.
3. **Find the Kth element in an array**
	- Easy solution is to sort an array and grab the kth element using the index or ***k-1***.
4. **Sort the array which has 0s and 1s without using any sorting algorithm.**
